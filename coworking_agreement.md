## Accessibility Needs
- Access to Internet
- Access to laptop
- Avalability of each person

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
We are planning to write code together pretty much the whole time, if there is anything we feel we can divide then we can. The tools that will help us collaborate is zoom, slack, VS code, and github.

## Learning Style
Each member has own learning style. 
Doing and experimenting;
observing and asking question;
reading documentation.
But, as a team, we support each style by pairing and encouring discussion.


## Preferred Feedback Style
We both perfer to recieve feedback directly but nice and in an understandable way (why that person feels that way).

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
We both want to work on collaborating with others at the same time rather then individually, and also communication.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
